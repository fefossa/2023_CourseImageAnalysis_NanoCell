# Metadata

Creating metadata from the filenames to get well and site information is essential to analyze your images.

Having a layout for your plate is also important, and you can also get information from that layout.

## Apps/notebooks

To create the metadata for your experiment containing information about the assay, like compound, concentration, etc, follow the instructions to use the [Layout to CSV app](https://github.com/broadinstitute/scripts_notebooks_fossa/tree/main/metadata).

To create metadata about image location and minimal information such as well, site, and plate, follow the instructions to use the [Load Data Generator app](https://github.com/broadinstitute/scripts_notebooks_fossa/tree/main/metadata)
