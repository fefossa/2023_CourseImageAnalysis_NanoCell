# 2023_CourseImageAnalysis_NanoCell

- Contains materials, documentation, and slides used in the **2023 Bioimage Analysis Course** for NanoCell Interactions Lab.

- This course is recorded in Portuguese, and the materials are available in English.

## Aims

Our aim is to provide a detailed material on how to plan, organize, and perform a bioimage analysis protocol using CellProfiler [1] for segmentation and feature extraction, pycytominer [2] for profiling, and Python for data visualization and interpretation. 

## Materials

For each day of the course, we will provide the written documentation, slides, and recording (in Portuguese).
